==============================
Measurement and adjoint source code stored in the SVN repository of
the Computational Infrastructure for Geodynamics (CIG).
   /cig/seismo/3D/ADJOINT_TOMO/measure_adj/

This package is complementary to FLEXWIN, the automated window-picking 
algorithm that is also stored at CIG. Both FLEXWIN and measure_adj were
used for the study of Tape-Liu-Maggi-Tromp (2009, Science), among others.

The code was last tested on 24-May-2011 using:
    openSUSE 11.3 Linux 64-bit
    gfortran 4.5.0
    64-bit SAC version 101.4, with patch

The plotting routines use pssac2 and GMT. If you want to use the plotting routines,
first compile pssac2 by following the instructions in UTILS/pssac2/README_supp.
The executable pssac2 is linked to PLOTS/pssac2.

Then for a test to see if things are working, try this:
   > cp PLOTS/9818433_T006_T030_MPM_CI_m16_iker07_win_adj_DEFAULT.pdf .
   > make clean
   > make
   > measure_adj
   > csh -f run_measure_adj.csh
If all goes well, you should produce the figure
   PLOTS/9818433_T006_T030_MPM_CI_m16_iker07_win_adj.pdf
to match 9818433_T006_T030_MPM_CI_m16_iker07_win_adj_DEFAULT.pdf

Please email Carl Tape (carltape@gi.alaska.edu) with questions, comments, or bug reports.
Users are wanted to help improve the package!

This package measures the transfer function for given data and synthetics, 
and then assimilates the measurements to create the adjoint source and 
misfit function values necessary for a gradient-based toographic inversion.

Input: MEASUREMENT.WINDOWS which has the format:

npairs-of-data-and-syn
data_file-pair-1
syn_file-pair-1
num_of_measurements 
tstart-1  tend-1
...
tstart-n  tend-n
data_file-pair-2
syn_file-pair-2
num_of_measurements
...
...


Output: *.txt *.sac and OUTPUT_FILES/*

For examples of different dataset, try other INPUT_FILES/MEASUREMENT_WINDOWS* files 
by copying them to MEASUREMENT.WINDOWS

One thing tricky:  change the measurement window length, while keeping 
the same number of tapers is going to change the frequency domain averaging width W, 
therefore, affect the smoothness (sometimes amplitude as well) of the adjoint source.

General scripts are found in the main directory:

write_par_file.pl  -- writes MEASUREMENT.PAR from a set of input numbers
prepare_adj_src.pl -- creates Z-E-N adjoint sources from Z-R-T adjoint sources

PLOTS/
  plot_win_adj_all.pl
  plot_win_adj.pl
  make_pdf_by_event.pl
  make_pdf_by_station.pl

Several scripts have been added to facilitate running multiple events 
and generating multiple plots for the purpose of a tomography inversion.  
These are by no means in the "final" user-friendly state.

These scripts have been placed in the directory scripts_tomo:

prepare_measure_adj.pl -- prepares the directory for running the measurement code WITH PLOTS
run_measure_adj.pl     -- runs the code and makes output plots
run_mt_cc_plot.pl         -- runs the code in cross-correlation mode AND multi-taper mode for plots
run_tomo.pl               -- master script that calls prepare_measure_adj.pl and run_measure_adj.pl
combine_2_adj_src.pl      -- combines two sets of adjoint sources and creates a new STATIONS_ADJOINT file
combine_2_adj_src_all.pl  -- calls combine_2_adj_src.pl repeatedly to make the final set of adjoint sources

These must be copied into the main directory to use them.

Finally, to make summary histogram plots for the measurements for each event,
as well as a single histogram for all measurements in total, see

PLOTS/plot_win_stats_all.pl
PLOTS/plot_win_stats.pl

This generates a succinct set of measurements and uncertainty estimates that is used for plotting.
