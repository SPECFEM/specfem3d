/seismo/3D/ADJOINT_TOMO/README

These directories contain tools needed for a seismic tomographic inversion using adjoint methods.

flexwin     -- FLEXWIN algorithm for automated picking of time windows
measure_adj -- reads FLEXWIN output file and makes measurements, 
                  with the option for computing adjoint sources
iterate_adj -- various tools for iterative inversion
                  (requires pre-computed "event kernels")

These tools were used within Tape-Liu-Maggi-Tromp (2009, 2010) for a topographic inversion of the southern California crust.

flexwin is a "finished" code release
measure_adj and iterate_adj are working directories

--------------

For a tomographic inversion, the suggested organizational structure is for each user to have the directory ADJOINT_TOMO_OUTPUT one directory up (but not on svn) and containing (at least) these directories:

ADJOINT_TOMO_OUTPUT
   model_plot_gmt_OUTPUT
   model_plot_matlab_OUTPUT
   misfit_plot_OUTPUT
   misfit_plot_INPUT
   vtkfiles

These are all associated with making plots of seismograms and cross sections from tomographic models.

To set this up, type these commands:

> mkdir ../ADJOINT_TOMO_OUTPUT
> ln -s ../ADJOINT_TOMO_OUTPUT .
> cd ADJOINT_TOMO_OUTPUT
> mkdir model_plot_gmt_OUTPUT model_plot_matlab_OUTPUT misfit_plot_OUTPUT misfit_plot_INPUT vtkfiles
> cd -
