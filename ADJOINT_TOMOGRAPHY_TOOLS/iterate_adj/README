iterate_adj is a collection of scripts needed to do adjoint tomography.
It is the third package in the sequence:

flexwin
measure_adj
iterate_adj

Several operations are done on pangu, like computing the Hessian matrix for the subspace method.  And several operations are done in Matlab, like choosing the damping parameter.  Thus, the two main directories for these processes are:

cluster         -- scripts are executed on a cluster
matlab          -- scripts are executed NOT on a cluster

Other directories are:

misfit_plot     -- directory for plotting seismogram comparisons from two different models
UTILS           -- various scripts for ploting figures
SEM2D_iterate   -- 2D test code for two inversion algorithms
                      conjugate gradient
                      source subspace method
