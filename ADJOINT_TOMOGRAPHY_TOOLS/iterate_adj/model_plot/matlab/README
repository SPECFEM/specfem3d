/ADJOINT_TOMO/iterate_adj/model_plot/matlab/

Matlab scripts for generating plotting grids that are used to extract values from SEM meshes.  Then, back in Matlab, we create new data files that are read into GMT.

The main script is socal_tomo_plots.m

This calls several non-built-in Matlab scripts that could probably be cleaned up or, in some cases, replaced.
