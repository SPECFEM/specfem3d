The primary programs here are compute_misfit.m and subspace_specfem.m

------------------

compute_misfit.m

After having run the measurement code, you can look at a set of misfit 
measurements using compute_misfit.m.  In order to tabulate various summaries 
of the dataset (picks by station, event, network, etc), the program reads in 
a concatenated list of CMTSOLUTION files, and also a STATIONS list.

------------------

subspace_specfem.m

After having run the measurement code AND the /subspace_hessian code (on the cluster), 
you can run subspace_specfem.m.  The output files will be placed in the subdirectories 
of OUTPUT, which can be generated using make_dirs.pl.  
(The user should keep a copy of these files somewhere not on SVN.)

Typically, one will generate, say, 100 model updates for 100 different regularization parameters, 
save the mu-vectors describing the linear combination of kernels describing the model update, 
and then generate the model updates on the cluster, using /subspace_update.
