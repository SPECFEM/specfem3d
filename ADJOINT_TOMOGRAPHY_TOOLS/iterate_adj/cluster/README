From CIG SVN server:
/ADJOINT_TOMO/iterate_adj/cluster/README

This is designed to provide guidance for doing an inversion using event kernels
derived from adjoint methods.  Programs are contained for the basic operations 
needed for a tomographic inversion based on adjoint methods.  
However, several minor adjustments need to be made for each user.

Email me (carltape@fas.harvard.edu) with suggestions for improvements.

Directions for user:

(1) Create a working directory
    cd /ADJOINT_TOMO/iterate_adj
    cp -r cluster cluster_work

(2) Copy slice file into topo_input/

(3) Compile combine_vol_data.f90 in /topo_input/combine_vol_data/

(4) Link your mesh topology files into topo/
    For example, for slice 162, we have these files:
      proc000162_AVS_DXelements.txt
      proc000162_AVS_DXpoints.txt
      proc000162_ibool.bin
      proc000162_jacobian2D.bin
      proc000162_jacobian.bin
      proc000162_x.bin
      proc000162_y.bin
      proc000162_z.bin
    The Jacobian is used for taking the norm of the model vectors.

(5) Link your smoothing directory to smooth/kernel_smoothing
      cd smooth
      ln -s /---/ADJOINT_TOMO_EXTRA/kernel_smoothing_basin/smooth_sem_fun .

(6) Link your kernels list
      cd KERNELS_MODELS
      ln -s /---/KERNELS_MODELS/kernels_run .

(7) Link unsmoothed kernels into approriate directory
      cd KERNELS_MODELS/event_kernels/kernel_m04
      ln -s /ibrixfs1/scratch/carltape/KERNELS_MODELS/event_kernels/kernel_m04/* .

(8) Link present model into appropriate directory
      cd KERNELS_MODELS/models/m04
      ln -s /ibrixfs1/scratch/carltape/KERNELS_MODELS/models/m04/* .

-----------------
NOTE: With mpich_gm, we needed to use the library file mpif.h.
      With openmpi, this file is automatically present.
      openmpi is our default and therefore no mpif.h file is present locally.

OPERATION DIRECTORIES:
sum_kernel       -- sum event kernels
smooth           -- smooth summed kernel or model update
smooth_all       -- setup directories for smoothing many event kernels at once
subspace_hessian -- compute hessian for subspace method
subspace_update  -- compute model update, after computing mu vectors in Matlab
model_vp_vs      -- add a model update to make a new vp and vs model
model_slice      -- nearest neighbor algorithm for grid for plotting cross sections

cg_step -- compute the conjugate-gradient test model

INPUT AND OUTPUT DIRECTORIES:
topo
topo_input
KERNELS_MODELS/

Other pertinent codes for the subspace method presently reside here:
/ADJOINT_TOMO/iterate_adj/matlab/

This is a sub-directory of the SVN package iterate_adj.
