/ADJOINT_TOMO/iterate_adj/pangu/scripts/README

These scripts are used in setting up the forward simulations and the kernel simulations.  
They are included as a guide only, and will need to be modified for a particular setup.

setup_forward_dir.pl
setup_kernel_dir.pl
copy_kernel_dir.pl
copy_SEM_dir.pl

In both cases, they require the directory Master_Dir, which is used to link run directories 
for all the requested event IDs.  The organization is as follows:

BASIN_KERNEL/
   setup_kernel_dir.pl
   Master_Dir/
   done_dirs/
       copy_kernel_dir.pl

BASIN_FORWARD/
   setup_forward_dir.pl
   Master_Dir/
   done_dirs/
       copy_SEM_dir.pl
