The ttimes package is based on the work of Buland and Chapman  (1983) BSSA 73,
1271-1302, and provides a convenient means of interpolating in tau-tables to
provide a rapid computation of travel times for multiple phases at a fixed
distance.  

The current versions were expanded to meet the needs of the iasp91 (1991) and
ak135 (1995) reference models by R. Buland with assistance from B. Kennett.
