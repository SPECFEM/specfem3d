1. rotate_adj_src utility helps to rotate the adjoint sources
calculated from the measurements to E, N, Z components which
is ready to go directly into SEM adjoint code.

2. combine_adj_src.pl -- directly copied over from old version. I assume
     the original purpose is to combine cc adjoint source for body
     waves and mt adjoint source for surface waves, it is probably
     not the best thing to use in practice, considering the possible
     weight one needs to add to the body waves in actual inversions.

2. A list of scripts that might worth transfering from old version
(a lot of them by Carl), notably run_mt_measure_adj.pl and 
plot_win_adj.pl. Keep in mind now our output seismograms are in SAC format.
