Dear Laura,

     The attachments are the tar.bz2 package of my DSM computation for smoothed model (d410 and d670). In this DSM package, you can using " mpirun -np  (number of processors)  ./xdsmti <data/input_IASP91_regular_nocrust_nod410_nod670.inf"  command to submit the MPI computation after compiling. The input files for this  smoothed model is ./data/input_IASP91_regular_nocrust_nod410_nod670.inf. The difference from original Takeuchi's DSM version is that we using the high precise Gauss quadrature instead of the old Simpson quadrature.
     The other thing you should notice is that the choice for ITYPE_SEISMOGRAMS in dsmti.F90 codes(This integer variable is used for choosing the :1 = displacement,  2 = velocity computation . In my case i choose ITYPE_SEISMOGRAMS = 2 for velocity computation and then i use SAC to do the time integration and ONLY highpass filter (command : highpass butter corner 0.00666666667 npoles 6 passes 2 ) . You can try to do our modified DSM computation as reference. If you have any problem, please contact me.

    Best wishes.


                                                                                                                                                                                                               Wang Yi

>> Dear Dimitri, my name is Laura Parisi and I am a PhD student in seismology working with Ana Ferreira (in Cc). I hope to not bother you too much with this email where I would like to ask you something about your work published in JGR in 2010 ('SHdiff-SVdiff splitting in a isotropic Earth'). I tried to reproduce your results, in particular figure 2 (left side) and 3, where you used your modified version of IASP91 model without any other perturbation in the D''. I have obtained a good match for figure 2 (seismograms in displacement at epicentral distance of 100?) but I am still struggling with figure 3 (seismograms in velocity at epicentral distance from 90? to 120?). For figure 2, the only processing I did is the convolution with the source function you indicate in the paper and using the script contained in the specfem package. For figure 3, I derivate to obtain the velocity seismograms but for epicentral distance larger than 104? I obtain seismograms containing very high frequencies (I think because the displacement amplitudes are very small). Then, I tried various filters to eliminate this effects but I couldn't obtain your same results. I suppose you did filter the seismograms in figure 3 but guessing exactly how is difficult! If you could advice me regarding the processing to obtain the results shown in figure 3, it would be very appreciated! :) Many thanks.
