Dear all,

Happy 20th anniversary SPECFEM / bon anniversaire SPECFEM !

The whole story started on April 4, 1995 when Yvon Maday (cc'ed) was kind enough to visit and give us explanations about how to use the spectral-element method, which he had co-developed with Anthony Patera at MIT. Let me thank Yvon again for that, and let me also thank my PhD advisor Jean-Pierre Vilotte for organizing that meeting. Attached are the notes from that meeting, as a souvenir I scanned them and put them in the "doc" directory of the code.

Let us also thank all the developers and users who have made it a success since then, i.e., you guys :-)

Best regards, Merci Ã  tous,

Dimitri.
