In order to keep the software package thread-safe in case a multithreaded
implementation of MPI is used, developers should not add modules or
common blocks to the source code but rather use regular subroutine
arguments (which can be grouped in ``derived types'' if needed for
clarity).\newline

The Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre subroutines in \texttt{gll\_library.f90}
are based in part on software libraries from the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, Department of Mechanical Engineering (Cambridge, Massachusetts,
USA). The non-structured global numbering software was provided by
Paul F. Fischer (Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island, USA,
now at Argonne National Laboratory, USA).\newline
