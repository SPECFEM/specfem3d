The svn trunk of SPECFEM3D_Cartesian contains the most current GPU routines.

You have to configure the package with the additional CUDA option:

./configure --with-cuda         ...        when using CUDA version 4.x
./configure --with-cuda=cuda5   ...        when using CUDA version 5.x

Once the compilation is successful, the examples run on GPUs when setting the flag GPU_MODE to .true. in DATA/Par_file.

Daniel.
