this regular mesh contains 36 x 36 x 16 elements:

36 elements along X

36 elements along Y

16 elements along Z

i.e. a total of 36 x 36 x 16 = 20736 elements.

 *** Xmin and Xmax of the model =   0.   134000. m
 *** Ymin and Ymax of the model =   0.   134000. m
 *** Zmin and Zmax of the model =   -60000. m    0.

 *** Max element size =    3750 m  along Z
 *** Min element size =    3722.219 m  along X and Y
 *** Max/min ratio =    1.007464



 *** Max GLL point distance =    1227.477 m
 *** Min GLL point distance =    642.7266 m
 *** Max/min ratio =    1.909796
