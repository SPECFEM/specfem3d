Hi Dimitri, Hi all,

Here I send you the FTI sources that were used at the time of our project in 2011, it is a very old version.

You can downnload the current version of FTI here: https://gforge.inria.fr/projects/fti/

Please note that FTI has evolved substantially since 2011 and the current API is completely different.

Hope this helps,
Leo
