Tomography model of Lin-Shearer-Hauksson-Thurber (2007).

The files pa_all-1 and ra_all-1 were obtained from Egill Hauksson June 2007.

pa_all-1 Vp tomography model for SoCal
ra_all-1 Vp/Vs tomography model for SoCal

In order to convert these files into the format of hauksson_new_format.dat (see haukson_model directory), I used a script in Matlab (hauksson_tomo_model.m; not included).  That output file is

lin_new_format.dat

Carl,
The Lin et al. Vp and Vp/Vs models are attached.  Just ignore the readme
file, it is related to something else.
Let me know how this goes.
Egill
