Tomography model of Lin-Shearer-Hauksson-Thurber (2007).

See lin_2007/README for details on the tomographic model.

hauk-lin.pdf shows some subtle differences between the
Hauksson (2000) model and the Lin et al. (2007) model.

new_bounds.pdf shows the nodes for the Lin model.
red dashed   -- 'standard' simulation domain
red solid    -- Hauksson interpolated regular grid domain
black dashed -- 'new' simulation domain (extended west)
black solid  -- new Hauksson interpolated regular grid domain

The starting file lin_new_format.dat was generated by
the Matlab script hauksson_tomo_model.m, which is included
here for completeness.

To generate lin_final_grid_smooth.dat, the file read in by SPECFEM3D,
you must execute runall.csh.

CHANGES TO RUN IN SPECFEM3D
-----------------------------------

First, in create_regions_mesh.f90, you need to uncomment the call to the
Lin et al. (2007) model and comment the call to the Hauksson (2000) model.

!    call get_value_string(HAUKSSON_REGIONAL_MODEL_FILE, &
!                          'model.HAUKSSON_REGIONAL_MODEL_FILE', &
!                          'DATA/hauksson_model/hauksson_final_grid_smooth.dat')
    call get_value_string(HAUKSSON_REGIONAL_MODEL_FILE, &
                          'model.HAUKSSON_REGIONAL_MODEL_FILE', &
                          'DATA/lin_model/lin_final_grid_smooth.dat')

Second, the parameters in constants.h need to be adjusted to reflect the slightly
different parameterization used in the Lin model versus the Hauksson model.
I have left the pertinent lines in SPECFEM3D/DATA/lin_model/constants.h; basically
you need to comment the Hauksson model lines and un-comment the Lin model lines.

Third, by having one less layer in the Lin model, I needed to make minor
adjustments to hauksson_model.f90, which I have copied to
SPECFEM3D/DATA/lin_model/hauksson_model.f90

Fourth, make sure the extended region is specified in the Par_file,
which I have copied to
SPECFEM3D/DATA/lin_model/Par_file

LONGITUDE_MIN                   = -121.6d0   ! -120.3d0
NEX_XI                          = 336
NEX_ETA                         = 288
NPROC_XI                        = 14
NPROC_ETA                       = 12

-----------------------------------

In the future, we can decide how to commit these changes.  For example, perhaps having
a LIN_MODEL option would be sensible, or eliminating the Hauksson model altogether,
since this is presubaly an updated version of his model.
