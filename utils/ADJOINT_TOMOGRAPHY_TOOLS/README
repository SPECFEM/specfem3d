Dimitri Komatitsch, September 2014:

for a detailed discussion about how the tomography tools are going to evolve, please see https://github.com/SPECFEM/specfem3d/issues/23

The text below is probably obsolete (at least in part), while the GitHub discussion is up to date.

The GitHub discussion also gives the URLs where these tools are developed and maintained.

Dimitri.

=====================================================

These directories contain tools needed for a seismic tomographic inversion using adjoint methods.

flexwin     -- FLEXWIN algorithm for automated picking of time windows
            -- THIS IS NOW STORED AS A STAND-ALONE CODE AT CIG
               https://github.com/geodynamics/flexwin
measure_adj -- reads FLEXWIN output file and makes measurements, 
                  with the option for computing adjoint sources
iterate_adj -- various tools for iterative inversion
                  (requires pre-computed "event kernels")

These tools were used within Tape-Liu-Maggi-Tromp (2009, 2010) for a topographic inversion of the southern California crust.

flexwin is a "finished" code release
measure_adj and iterate_adj are working directories

--------------

For a tomographic inversion, the suggested organizational structure is for each user to have the directory ADJOINT_TOMO_OUTPUT one directory up (but not on svn) and containing (at least) these directories:

ADJOINT_TOMO_OUTPUT
   model_plot_gmt_OUTPUT
   model_plot_matlab_OUTPUT
   misfit_plot_OUTPUT
   misfit_plot_INPUT
   vtkfiles

These are all associated with making plots of seismograms and cross sections from tomographic models.

To set this up, type these commands:

> mkdir ../ADJOINT_TOMO_OUTPUT
> ln -s ../ADJOINT_TOMO_OUTPUT .
> cd ADJOINT_TOMO_OUTPUT
> mkdir model_plot_gmt_OUTPUT model_plot_matlab_OUTPUT misfit_plot_OUTPUT misfit_plot_INPUT vtkfiles
> cd -
