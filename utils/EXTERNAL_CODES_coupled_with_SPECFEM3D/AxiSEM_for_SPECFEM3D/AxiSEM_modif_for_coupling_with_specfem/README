Basic instructions for running:

More details are found in the manual. For a quick start:

The mesher has to be run first, in order to generate a SEM mesh for the solver. 
Any changes in the resolution, spherically symmetric background model, or number 
of processors requires a new mesh. 
Changes in the source-receiver settings or 2.5D heterogeneities need a new solver run.
Changes on the moment tensor need a new postprocessing run.

General settings and explanations for parameters needed in MESHER and SOLVER 
are found in the inparam_* files in the respective directories. 

1) Run copytemplates.sh to set up a generic run with pre-set parameters

2) Go into the MESHER directory, run ./submit.csh . This compiles the code using
gfortran and mpif90 as default compilers, and then submits a job on a single node. 
For high resolution (seismic period below 3s), this requires significant amounts 
of RAM, see manual.

3) Check OUTPUT; if finished, then run ./movemesh.csh <MESH_NAME>

4) go into SOLVER/MESHES/<MESH_NAME> , check vtk files with paraview

5) Edit inparam_basic to the desired <MESH_NAME>

6) Run ./submit.csh <RUN_NAME> , this compiles and then submits a parallel run.

7) Check <RUN_NAME>/OUTPUT*

8) All data-related output is in <RUN_NAME>/Data/

9) Convolution with a STF and summation for a moment source is done by running
   postprocessing.csh in <RUN_NAME>
