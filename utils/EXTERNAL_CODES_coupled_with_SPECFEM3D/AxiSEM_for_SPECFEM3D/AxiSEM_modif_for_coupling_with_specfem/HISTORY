 - External 1D models
 - Models can include solid and fluid zones
 - Axially symmetric heterogeneities
 - Attenuation
 - Anisotropy
 - General moment tensor and force sources
 - Receiver locations on the surface
 - Benchmarked for elastic models against yspec (Al Attar & Woodhose, 2008) 
   up to 1 Hz
 - Newmark time integration scheme tested and benchmarked against YSPEC
 - Symplectic time integration scheme tested, but not fully benchmarked
 - NetCDF output
