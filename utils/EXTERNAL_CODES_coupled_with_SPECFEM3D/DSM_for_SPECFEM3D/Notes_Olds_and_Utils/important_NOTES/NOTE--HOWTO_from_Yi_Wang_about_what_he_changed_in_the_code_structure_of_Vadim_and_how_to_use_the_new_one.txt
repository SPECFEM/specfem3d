Dear dimitri,

I didn't change anything in Vadim's DSM codes of PSV
parts. In the new Hybrid package, i just merged and modified DSM codes
of SH parts. Maybe there are some differences in the makefile for my SH
DSM computation from Vadim's PSV parts. But I think my SH DSM
contributions are self-consistent.

The major change of new Hybrid package is the new directory
structure. For Vadim's old PSV Hybrid computation, the directories
structure contain every part of codes is like below :

  |-- bin
  |-- Part1_create_SPECFEM3D_Cartesian_mesh_for_DSM
  |-- Part2_compute_DSM_coefficients_with_FEMs
  |-- Part3_read_DSM_coefficients_back
  | |-- TraPSV_MPI_read_vertical_faces
  | `-- TraPSV_MPI_read_Zmin
  |-- Part4_modify_DSM_results_for_SPECFEM
  | |-- ChangeFormat
  | |-- ChangeFormat_disp
  | |-- ChangeFormat_zmin
  | |-- ChangeFormat_zmin_disp
  | |-- FFT_MPI_FACES_VERT
  | |-- FFT_MPI_FACES_ZMIN
  | `-- Interf_SPECFEM3D_DSM
  |-- shared
  |-- shells
  `-- UTILS

For my new Hybrid merge the SH contributions, the directories structure contain every part of codes is :

  |-- bin
  |-- Part1_create_SPECFEM3D_Cartesian_mesh_for_DSM
  |-- Part2_compute_DSM_coefficients_with_FEMs_PSV
  |-- Part2_compute_DSM_coefficients_with_FEMs_SH
  |-- Part3_read_DSM_coefficients_back_PSV
  | |-- TraPSV_MPI_read_vertical_faces
  | `-- TraPSV_MPI_read_Zmin
  |-- Part3_read_DSM_coefficients_back_SH
  | |-- TraPSV_MPI_read_vertical_faces
  | `-- TraPSV_MPI_read_Zmin
  |-- Part4_modify_DSM_results_for_SPECFEM
  | |-- ChangeFormat
  | |-- ChangeFormat_disp
  | |-- ChangeFormat_zmin
  | |-- ChangeFormat_zmin_disp
  | |-- FFT_MPI_FACES_VERT_FULL
  | |-- FFT_MPI_FACES_VERT_PSV
  | |-- FFT_MPI_FACES_VERT_SH
  | |-- FFT_MPI_FACES_ZMIN_FULL
  | |-- FFT_MPI_FACES_ZMIN_PSV
  | |-- FFT_MPI_FACES_ZMIN_SH
  | `-- Interf_SPECFEM3D_DSM
  |-- shared
  |-- shells
  `-- UTILS

     I move Vadim's DSM codes of PSV part into the directory end with
_PSV. My DSM codes of SH parts is in the directory end with _SH. For the
full wavefields computation, I move the relative codes into the
directories end with _FULL. (in fact , only the FFT routines may
consider 3 different cases: full wavefields/PSV/SH  transform).

     I also modified and added some control scripts for DSM computation
in the shells directory, they are:

     ./shells/scripts_dsm_full.sh

     ./shell/scripts_dsm_PSV.sh

     ./shell/scripts_dsm_SH.sh

     Best wishes,

     YI
