Hi Yi,

you will find some example of scripts for Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) on the Curie machine,

/ccc/scratch/cont003/gen6351/vmont/NEW_INVERSION_SYNTH/run/inversion_fwi_model_liss

I think you can read all files in this directory.

This is an synthetic example for FWI example  made for our paper2.

To run the FWI you have to submit the bacth : msub_lance_invesion_gamma_FWI_liss_gauss_3_sub_it.sh


All the fortan codes you need and shells scripts are in:

/ccc/scratch/cont003/gen6351/vmont/NEW_INVERSION_SYNTH/codes

Take a look at the scripts and ask me I you need help.

Sebastien told me that you want to performs some testes for real data. I computed the tractions for the 24/05/2012 event  reccorded by the first profile. You will find them in :

  /ccc/store/cont003/gen6351/vmont/pyrope/Tract_201205242247A/

This tractions and velocity not filterd and not convloved. In the directory


/ccc/scratch/cont003/gen6351/vmont/compute_tractions_for_pyrope

You will find scripts to compute the gradient for real data (msub_run_simu_adj.sh).
