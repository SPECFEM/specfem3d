Hi all,

it could be that the source discontinuity is already handled as suggested by Vadim (following eq 17 of Friederich_Dalkolmo_GEMINI_GJI_1995.pdf) because the source code of Takeuchi contains this in file param.f90:

    if ( itmp>maxngrid_r ) call error_handling(11)
    grid_r(itmp) = rmin_structure_zone(i_zone) + rh * dble(i) / dble( ngrid )

! ------ putting an additional node on the source location
    if ( itmp>2 ) then
      if ( ( grid_r(itmp-1)<source_r ).and. &
                   ( source_r<grid_r(itmp) ) ) then


but I am not sure if this just adds a point at the source location (which is *not* sufficient) or if there are more code lines in the rest of the code that handle the explicit treatment of the source discontinuity. It will be important to check that.

Thanks,
Dimitri.
