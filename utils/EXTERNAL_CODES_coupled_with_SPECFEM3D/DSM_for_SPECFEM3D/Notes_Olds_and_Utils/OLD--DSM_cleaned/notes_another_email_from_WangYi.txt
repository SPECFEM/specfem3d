So there are still some discrepancies and time shift between Takeuchi's and
Kawai's DSM codes. I think the difference comes from source treatment.

             I check the Kawai's codes again, he represent the solution of weak
form of elastic equation of motion as the sum of a particular solution( with
some special boundary condition) and a unknown homogeneous solution. Then by doing
some mathematical treatment, solving the DSM equation of motion. The idea of
this method is shown in Geller and Hatori 's G.J.I paper 'DSM synthetic seismograms
 using analytic trial functions planelayered, isotropic, case', from formula (1)
 to (12) . Also, Takeuchi and Geller's 2003 G.J.I paper 'Accurate numerical methods
for solving the elastic equation of motion for arbitrary source locations.'
explained and generalized this idea (section 3 SOURCE REPRESENTATION). I attach
these 2 paper ,for your reference.
