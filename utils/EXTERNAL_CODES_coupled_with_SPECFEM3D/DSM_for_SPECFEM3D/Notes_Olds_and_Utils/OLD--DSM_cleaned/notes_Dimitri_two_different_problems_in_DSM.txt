Hi all,

I think the best paper to understand the code of Takeuchi is Takeuchi and Geller, GRL, 1996, because the notations and exactly the same.

Attached is my annotated PDF.

There are two different issues:

1/ as we discussed, they use linear basis functions; we should change that, but that means changing all the submatrices in eq (3) and also the block-tridiagonal structure below eq (5); that is feasible but it is a lot of work

2/ independently, and more problematically, they mass lump, i.e. they compute the integrals of eq (3) based on a Simpson rule of very high degree (degree 256) and then assign it to the single middle point of the linear basis function, i.e. to a single point; here it is easy to switch to better integration than Simpson, which is what I did yesterday by adding Gauss; it works fine, and improves things a bit, but they still mass lump and thus most of the improvement is lost by the averaging to a single middle point that is done because of mass lumping.

My main concern is that it is clear (although a bit difficult technically) to fix point 1/ above, but I do not know how to get rid of mass lumping i.e. of point 2/ above.

(in principle, in FEM theory one mass-lumps to avoid having to solve a large matrix system, but here I do not understand why they do not simply decide to solve it; i.e. I am not sure *why* they mass lump).

Takeuchi knows about this problem because in the attached PDF on page 2 he mentions that for at least two of his current sub-integrals he would need a higher-order approximation because terms I3 ans I6 implement a second-order derivative.

Cheers,
Dimitri.
