Subject: how can we compute strain "seismograms" in the DSM code?

Dear Nobuaki,

Did you have time to talk to Prof. Takeuchi or Prof. Kawai
about how to output values of strain instead of displacement or velocity
in the DSM code, i.e. compute strain "seismograms" in addition to more
classical velocity or displacement seismograms?
Because as we discussed when you came to Toulouse, for some applications
it would be interesting to be able to output the components of the
strain tensor.

I copy this email to Prof. Takeuchi for information.

Thank you,
Best regards,

Dimitri.
