Hi,

the coupled SPECFEM code is SPECFEM3D_HYBRID_VADIM_version_non_official. 
Before running it you must run DSM code in order to create the incident 
wavefield on the box boundary. DSM consists in 4 steps. Each code is in 
Part1(2,3,4)_* directory.

In the example directory, there is a benchmark to run all process (DSM+ SPECFEM) : bacchus_run_benchmark_all_process.sh.
