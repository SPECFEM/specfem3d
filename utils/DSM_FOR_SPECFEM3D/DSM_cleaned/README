**********  Welcome to the DSM world.  **********

This is a package for full computations of three-component
synthetic seismograms for a spherically symmetric TI
(transversely isoropic) Earth model using the Direct Solution Method (DSM).


CONFIGURATION:
-------------

  After editing environment variables in 'Makefile', type:

      make all

  To compile the code for serial runs instead of MPI runs, in the Makefile uncomment the -DUSE_SERIAL line before compiling.


USAGE:
-----

  To run the code in parallel (MPI) mode, type this:

      mpirun -np number_of_processor_cores_to_use ./xdsmti < data/010109.inf

  To run the code in serial mode, type this:

      ./xdsmti < data/010109.inf

  See file 'HOWTO_USE' for details.

!
! Important remark from Nozomu Takeuchi:
!
! The code computes synthetics in the frequency domain and incorporates
! small (constant) imaginary part in the angular frequency to reduce
! wraprounds.  The obtained seismograms are therefore less accurate
! for lower frequencies.
! You might have to apply high-pass filters to remove low frequency noise.

!
! Another important remark from Nozomu Takeuchi and Dimitri Komatitsch:
!
! The code computes velocity Green functions for Heaviside function source time history
! (or displacement Green functions for delta function source time history).
! To obtain displacement seismograms, we should integrate the obtained seismograms.
! The flag below is used to select that:
!
  logical, parameter :: ITYPE_SEISMOGRAMS = 2   !   1 = displacement, 2 = velocity
