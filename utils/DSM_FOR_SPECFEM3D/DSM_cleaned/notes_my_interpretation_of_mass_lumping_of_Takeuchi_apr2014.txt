Hi Roland, Hi all,

Yes, what is really strange about their "mass lumping" is that in the attached 1996 paper they solve equation (1) with finite elements but at the end of the same page in the last paragraph in the red box they say that H and T are already tridiagonal, and thus the matrix system is obvious to solve and there is no need to mass lump because solving a tridiagonal system is extremely easy.

Thus I think what they call mass lumping is in fact not mass lumping but rather a sum that they do on their sub-grid of ns = 256 points, thus it is "a bit the same philosophy" as mass lumping because it means using an integral on all the points of the sub-grid to compute the sum, and then ignoring this sub-grid and using that sum at a single point instead. But strictly speaking it is not mass lumping, it is just "a bit similar" I think. In any case, if T is banded (tridiagonal) there is no need to mass lump to solve the matrix system.

Thanks,
Dimitri.
