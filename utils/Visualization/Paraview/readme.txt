ParaView, ParaView is an open-source, multi-platform application designed to visualize data sets
http://www.paraview.org/

- various files provided to create your visualizations


- contains mesh2vtu/:

  mesh2vtu/ -- it requires the installation of vtk package. 
               once vtk is installed, you can set the vars 
               in the Makefile and compile all the programs

  How to collect and visualize 3D/2D data generated by the parallel simulation?

  - figure out the slices you need to collect    
  - combine all the databases using the program 'combine_vol_data.f90' or 'combine_surf_data.f90'
  - convert the mesh file to vtu file using mesh2vtu/, that is, 
    compile mesh2vtu/mesh2vtu by using `make` 
    and call the provided script > mesh2vtu.pl -i my_input.mesh -o my_output.vtu
  - visualize the .vtu files in Paraview  



- contains visualize_gold/:

  creates file formats for Paraview and 
  
  Ensight Gold, parallel processing and rendering visualization
