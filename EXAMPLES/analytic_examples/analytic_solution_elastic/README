Small elastic simulation to compare against an analytical solution (for test purposes).

The (semi-)analytical solution is calculated according to Aki & Richards, eq. (4.32) and eq. (4.33)
for a double-couple source. 

Analytical solutions are created by the script analytical_solution_Aki.py and provided in REF_ANALYTICAL/ folder.
Reference solutions created by SPECFEM are in REF_SEIS/ folder.

To run the example simulation, use script:
> ./run_this_example.sh

Compare your seismograms in OUTPUT_FILES/ with the reference ones in directory REF_SEIS/
The script ../utils/compare_seismogram_correlations.py can be used for running trace-by-trace comparisons.
