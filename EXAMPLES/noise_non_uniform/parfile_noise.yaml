# MESH INFORMATION
# ================
# int NPROC: Number of MPI processors.
# int NSPEC_SURFACE_EXT_MESH: Number of spectral elements on the surface (use value in OUTPUT_FILES/surface_from_mesher.h).
# str DATABASES_MPI: Path to DATABASES_MPI.
# int NGLLSQUARE: Number of GLL points per spectral element face. By default, keep this at 25.

# NOISE DIRECTION
# ===============
# float <X,Y,Z>DIR: Components of a unit vector indicating the noise direction.
XDIR: 0.0
YDIR: 0.0

# NOISE DISTRIBUTIONS
# ===================
# list DISTRIBUTIONS: List containing dictionaries that define noise distributions (uniform, ocean, gaussian).
# Each distribution is added to form one final distribution. Modify at your convenience.
#
# Available distributions:
# uniform: Uniform noise source.
# ocean:  Noise source only at the ocean.
# gaussian: 2D gaussian anomaly. If utm_zone: null, set the center in the mesh coordinates, otherwise use lon/lat.
