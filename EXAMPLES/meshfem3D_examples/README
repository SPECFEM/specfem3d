Examples contained in this folder help to familiarize yourself with the new 
in-house mesher xmeshfem3D (no CUBIT needed). We suggest to start with:

simple examples:

- simple_model/: a model with topography, an internal interface and a mesh doubling layer

- socal1D/: a 1D standard velocity model for Southern California

more complex example are provided in:

- many_interfaces/: a model with topography and several internal interfaces defined

please consider submitting your own example to this package!
