This example creates a small mesh with regular elements and surrounded by a C-PML absorbing boundary.
The model is split into two domains, the upper half is fluid (salt water) and the lower half viscoelastic (Marls-type rock).


To run this simulation, type:
> ./run_this_example.sh


Compare your seismograms in OUTPUT_FILES/ with the reference ones in directory REF_SEIS/
