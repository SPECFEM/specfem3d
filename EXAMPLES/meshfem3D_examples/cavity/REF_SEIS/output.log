 Recombining all movie frames to create a movie


 reading parameter file

   high-resolution:  T
   moviedata element surfaces:           72
   moviedata total elements all:         1800

 Velocity will be shown in movie

 1 = create files in OpenDX format
 2 = create files in AVS UCD format
 3 = create files in GMT xyz Ascii long/lat/Uz format
 any other value = exit

 enter value:
 movie frames have been saved every          200  time steps

 enter first time step of movie (e.g. 1, enter -1 for shaking map)
 enter last time step of movie (e.g.         3000 )

 1 = define file names using frame number
 2 = define file names using time step number
 any other value = exit

 enter value:

 looping from            1  to         3000  every          200  time steps

 total number of frames will be           15

 movie data:
 1= norm of velocity  2=velocity x-comp 3=velocity y-comp 4=velocity z-comp


 there are a total of         1152  elements at the surface
