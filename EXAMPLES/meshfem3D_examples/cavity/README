CAVITY FILE:
==================

In order to create a cavity, a file with the required information has to be
created. Then the appropriate file name should be provided in 
Mesh_par_file in the line:

CAVITY_FILE = cavity.dat

The cavity file has the following format:
- First line  : description
- Second line : number of cavities (currently either 0 or 1 only)
- Third line  : description
- Fourth line : range of cavity -> x0, x1, y0, y1, z0, z1

Example 1: "cavity.dat"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# number of cavities (currently supported only 0 or 1)                                     
1                                                                                
# range of cavity (x0, x1, y0, y1, z0, z1 in m)                                  
145.5d0 147.0d0 0.00d0 144.0d0 -10.50d0 -9.0d0 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Above information creates a cavity of the size 1.5 along X, 144.0 along Y, and
1.5 along Z directions, respectively.

Example 2: "no_cavity.dat"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# number of cavities (currently supported only 0 or 1)                                     
0                                                                                
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Above information does not create any cavities.

NOTE:
==================

Cavity is created removing the elements from the cavity region. Therefore the
element size in the cavity region should be less or equal to the cavity size.

LIMITATIONS:
==================

- Currently, only a single rectangular cavity can be created.
- Cavity axis must be parallel to the coordinate axis.
- Cavity cross-section must lie entirely on a single partition if running a
  parallel program 


KNOWN ISSUES:
==================
- if the cavity cross-section is shared among more than 1 processors, program
  crashes
