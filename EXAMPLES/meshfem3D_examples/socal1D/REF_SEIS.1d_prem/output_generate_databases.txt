 NSPEC_global_min =         3456
 NSPEC_global_max =         3456
 NSPEC_global_max / NSPEC_global_min imbalance =    1.00000000      =    0.00000000      %
 NSPEC_global_sum =         3456

 NGLOB_global_min =       232009
 NGLOB_global_max =       232009
 NGLOB_global_max / NGLOB_global_min imbalance =    1.00000000      =    0.00000000      %
 NGLOB_global_sum =       232009

 If you have elements of a single type (all acoustic, all elastic, all poroelastic, and without CPML)
 in the whole mesh, then there should be no significant imbalance in the above numbers.
 Otherwise, it is normal to have imbalance in elements and points because the domain decomposer
 compensates for the different cost of different elements by partitioning them unevenly among processes.

 Attenuation:
   The code uses a constant Q quality factor, but approximated
   based on a series of Zener standard linear solids (SLS).

   Approximation is performed in the following frequency band:
   Reference frequency requested by the user (Hz):  0.333330005      period (s):   3.00003004

   The following values are computed automatically by the code
   based on the estimated maximum frequency resolution of your mesh
   and can thus vary from what you have requested.

   Frequency band        min/max (Hz):   6.89431513E-03  0.387695819
   Period band           min/max (s) :   2.57934165       145.047043
   Logarithmic central frequency (Hz):   5.17000705E-02  period (s):   19.3423328

   Using full attenuation with both Q_kappa and Q_mu.
   Q_mu min/max           :    600.000000       600.000000
