README
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This folder contains several examples with increasing complexities.


To familiarize yourself with the package and CUBIT support, 
we suggest to start with:

- homogeneous_halfspace/: a model with a single constant material description.

  Use the script "run_this_example.sh" in that directory to run the simulation,
  or execute the step-by-step instructions in the README from that directory.

More complex examples are provided in:

- layered_halfspace/: a model with different material layers used for benchmarking

- waterlayered_halfspace/: a model with fluid-solid coupling

- tomographic_model/: a model used together with of a tomographic file for the material description

- noise_tomography/: uses the homogeneous_halfspace model for noise kernel simulations

- Mount_StHelens/: a model with topography data included

- homogeneous_poro/: a model using poroelastic material

***NOTE*** 
because of the poroelastic implementation, even in an acoustic/elastic case, 
the file nummaterial_poroelastic_file must be present in the MESH/ directory. 
Need to had a dummy file in cubit2specfem3d.py [CM - Oct. 2011]
For now it can be copied from examples/homogeneous_poro/MESH_coarse.
**********


To familiarize yourself with the new in-house mesher xmeshfem3D (no CUBIT needed),
you can follow the examples in:

- meshfem3d_examples/ 


To familiarize yourself with simulations using CPML absorbing boundaries, 
you can follow the examples in:

- CPML_examples/


To familiarize yourself with simulations using dynamic/kinematic rupture models,
you can follow the examples in:

- fault_examples/

please consider submitting your own example to this package! 
email us: cig-seismo AT geodynamics.org

VERY IMPORTANT: Note from Emanuele Casarotti about how to set up the CUBIT (now called TRELIS) and GEOCUBIT meshing packages:

you should set the pythonpath as in the example "homogeneous" (basically installing geocubit....)

CUBIT 14 for mac
python2.5 setup.py install --install-lib=/Library/Python/2.5/site-packages/

TRELIS 14 for mac
python2.6 setup.py install --install-lib=/Library/Python/2.6/site-packages/

on a Linux machine

check that the version of cubit 32/64 bit matches the python version...

in order to have the possibility to import cubit in a python script.

Set CUBITHOME to the directory where you installed CUBIT
export CUBITDIR=$CUBITHOME
export CUBITLIB=$CUBITDIR/bin:$CUBITDIR/structure
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$CUBITDIR/bin:$CUBITDIR/structure
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$CUBITDIR/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$CUBITDIR/bin

type "source setpaths.sh" in CUBIT_GEOCUBIT/ directory
