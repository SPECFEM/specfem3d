This examples uses the coffee cup mesh to run a simulation with coupled acoustic/elastic domains.
The source is placed inside the coffee (acoustic domain). The example is purely for fun. 


The mesh is provided by the Cubit/Trelis file `coffee_cup_with_handle_CUBIT_mesh.cub`. For running 
the simulation one needs:

* block definitions for exporting the mesh to SPECFEM format:
  For such an irregular mesh, they can be created by running the script `create_mesh.py` within Cubit/Trelis (-> Play script file...).

  This has already been done for the provided cubit *.cub file.

* run cubit2specfem to export files to a MESH/ folder: 
  can be done by running the script `run_cubit2specfem3d.py` within Cubit/Trelis.

  This has already been done for the default mesh provided in folder MESH-default/.


To run the simulation, type:
> ./run_this_example.sh


The simulation creates movie files which can be converted to AVS*.inp files by the script:
> ./xcreate_movie_files.sh

Paraview can be used to view these files. Enjoy :)
