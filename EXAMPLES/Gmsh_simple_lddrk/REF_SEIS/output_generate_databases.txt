   ...checking mesh resolution
 Mesh resolution:

 ********
 minimum and maximum number of elements
 and points in the CUBIT + SCOTCH mesh:

 NSPEC_global_min =           80
 NSPEC_global_max =           80
 NSPEC_global_max / NSPEC_global_min imbalance =    1.00000000      =    0.00000000      %
 NSPEC_global_sum =          320

 NGLOB_global_min =         6137
 NGLOB_global_max =         6137
 NGLOB_global_max / NGLOB_global_min imbalance =    1.00000000      =    0.00000000      %
 NGLOB_global_sum =        24548

 If you have elements of a single type (all acoustic, all elastic, all poroelastic, and without CPML)
 in the whole mesh, then there should be no significant imbalance in the above numbers.
 Otherwise, it is normal to have imbalance in elements and points because the domain decomposer
 compensates for the different cost of different elements by partitioning them unevenly among processes.

   ...saving attenuation databases

 Attenuation:
   The code uses a constant Q quality factor, but approximated
   based on a series of Zener standard linear solids (SLS).

   Approximation is performed in the following frequency band:
   Reference frequency requested by the user (Hz):  0.333330005      period (s):   3.00003004

   The following values are computed automatically by the code
   based on the estimated maximum frequency resolution of your mesh
   and can thus vary from what you have requested.

   Frequency band        min/max (Hz):   9.22862813E-03  0.518963933
   Period band           min/max (s) :   1.92691624       108.358459
   Logarithmic central frequency (Hz):   6.92049488E-02  period (s):   14.4498329
