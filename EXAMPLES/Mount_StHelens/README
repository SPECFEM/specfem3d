This example creates a single block model with topography around Mount St.Helens
using CUBIT, and runs a forward simulation.

step-by-step tutorial:

0. preparing topography data:

    a low resolution 'ptopo.mean.utm' file is provided to run the example,
    this would be the procedure to create it yourself:

   a) You can get SRTM 90m Digital Elevation Data for a
      region of interest at: http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org

      For this example, we choose Mount St.Helens as region of interest.
      Mount St. Helens is located at: 46.197 N 122.186 W

      It is contained in the download: srtm_12_03.zip
      (see http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/SELECTION/inputCoord.asp
        region of interest:   Latitude min: 45 N  max: 50 N
                              Longitude min: 125 W max: 120 W )

      unzipping the file
        > unzip srtm_12_03.zip
      leads to:
        ..
        srtm_12_03.tif
        ..

   b) To convert the tif-file into an lon-lat-elevation format, you can use the
      package FWTools at: http://fwtools.maptools.org/

      install the package and use their gdal2xyz executable to extract
      into xyz format:
        > FWTools-2.0.6/bin_safe/gdal2xyz.py srtm_12_03.tif > srtm_12_03.xyz

      the file 'srtm_12_03.xyz' has now the format: #longitude #latitude #elevation (m)
      (the file size is ~ 963 MB)

   c) Extract the detailed region of interest:

      To further extract and manipulate the topography data, you can use the
      package GMT at: http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/

      For our purposes, the region of interest will be: -R-122.3/-122.1/46.1/46.3
      (~23.5 km x 23.5 km )

      Using the blockmean executable, we extract and interpolate the topography data
      for the detailed region, using an interpolated grid spacing of 0.006 degrees ~ 700 m:
        > blockmean srtm_12_03.xyz -R-122.3/-122.1/46.1/46.3 -I0.006/0.006 > ptopo.mean.xyz

   c) Since the mesh will need Cartesian coordinates, we convert the topography file
      from (longitude/latitude/elevation) to UTM (X/Y/Z) coordinates.
      Mount St.Helens lies in the UTM zone: 10 (T).

      Use the script 'convert_lonlat2utm.pl' provided in this example folder:
        > ./convert_lonlat2utm.pl ptopo.mean.xyz 10 > ptopo.mean.utm
      to create a new file 'ptopo.mean.utm' with format: #UTM_X #UTM_Y #Z


1. create an STL surface from topography data:

      run script in CUBIT:
      claro -> Menu "Tools" -> "Play Journal File" ... and select file: "read_topo.py"

      this reads in the input file with name: ptopo.mean.utm
      and should create a file: topo.stl

      note: CUBIT has limited features when using facets/STL file formats.
            It is in general preferable to work with ACIS formats.

            However, using an ACIS topography file leads to a slower meshing process.
            This is why we prefer to use STL file formats here, but rely on
            a developer command (script was tested using CUBIT version 12.2).


2. create mesh:

   - run cubit GUI:
     > claro

     then run meshing script:
     claro -> Menu "Tools" -> "Play Journal File" ... and select file: "mesh_mount.py"

     this creates all the mesh files in subdirectory MESH/


3. run processing script for a default simulation on 4 CPUs (must have access to mpi):

    - run script 'process.sh' in this example directory:
      > ./process.sh

      this script handles the following steps:
        - decomposes mesh files (example creates 4 partitions from mesh files given in MESH/)
        - runs the database generation
        - runs a single forward simulation (using the default setup files in DATA/)
