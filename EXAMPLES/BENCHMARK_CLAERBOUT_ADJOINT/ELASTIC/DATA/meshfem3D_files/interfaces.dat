# number of interfaces

# We describe each interface below, structured as a 2D-grid, with several parameters : 
# number of points along XI and ETA, minimal XI ETA coordinates 
# and spacing between points which must be constant.
# Then the records contain the Z coordinates of the NXI x NETA points.
