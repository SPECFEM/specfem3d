Elastic benchmark

This test can be done on your workstation, as long as you have 4 CPUs available.
it should be done within 5 minutes. 


To run this test, simply use (after ./configure):

./run_inhomogeneous.bash


You will be given information at the very end:

 DATASPACE      = ?
 MODELSPACE     = ?
 relative error = ?

Check "relative error", it must be small enough (~0.1 should be OK).
If the test fails, PURE ELASTIC kernel calculation is problematic.
