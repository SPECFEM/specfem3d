Acoustic benchmark

This test can be done on your workstation, as long as you have 4 CPU cores available.
it should be done within 5 minutes. 


To run this test, simply use (after ./configure):

./run_inhomogeneous.bash


you will be given information at the very end:

 DATASPACE      =  ?
 MODELSPACE     =  ?
 relative error =  ?

Check "relative error", it must be small enough (~0.1 should be OK).
If the test fails, PURE ACOUSTIC kernel calculation is problematic.
