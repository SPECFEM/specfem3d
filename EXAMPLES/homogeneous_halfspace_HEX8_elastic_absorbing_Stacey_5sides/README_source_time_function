README - homogeneous halfspace using externally defined source time function
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This example uses an externally defined source time function with the homogeneous halfspace model, to run a
forward simulation.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
note: this example needs the user to have run a forward simulation based on the detailed step-by-step tutorial
      given in the file SPECFEM3D/EXAMPLES/homogeneous_halfspace/README

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Step-by-step tutorial:

1. Rerun the example given in SPECFEM3D/EXAMPLES/homogeneous_halfspace/README with the following modifications
   before running the solver -
   
   a. Copy the "source_time_function.txt" file to the specfem working directory.
      > cp EXAMPLES/homogeneous_halfspace/source_time_function.txt .   

   b. In the CMTSOLUTION file, add the full name of the source time function file
      "source_time_function.txt" as the ending line.

   c. In the Par_file, set 'USE_EXTERNAL_SOURCE_FILE = .true.'.

   IMPORTANT NOTE: The first line of the source time function file is the value of the time step, same as the simulation time step,
   and the following lines are the values of the moment vs. time function, and NOT the moment rate vs. time function.

2. Compare the generated seismograms with the reference ones, based on step 7 of the example given in
   SPECFEM3D/EXAMPLES/homogeneous_halfspace/README

   IMPORTANT NOTE: The externally provided source time function here, is the same as the one used by default in the
   homogeneous halfspace example when the source time function is not externally provided. Hence, the output seismograms should look
   the same as those in the default example.
