 Fixing slow underflow trapping problem using small initial field

 There are            4  MPI processes
 Processes are numbered from 0 to            3

 There is a total of            4  slices

  NDIM =            3

  NGLLY =            5

 and points in the CUBIT + SCOTCH mesh:

 NSPEC_global_min =         5184
 NSPEC_global_max =         5184
 NSPEC_global_max / NSPEC_global_min imbalance =    1.00000000      =    0.00000000      %
 NSPEC_global_sum =        20736

 NGLOB_global_min =       346385
 NGLOB_global_max =       346385
 NGLOB_global_max / NGLOB_global_min imbalance =    1.00000000      =    0.00000000      %
 NGLOB_global_sum =      1385540

 If you have elements of a single type (all acoustic, all elastic, all poroelastic, and without CPML)
 in the whole mesh, then there should be no significant imbalance in the above numbers.
 Otherwise, it is normal to have imbalance in elements and points because the domain decomposer
 compensates for the different cost of different elements by partitioning them unevenly among processes.
