0.Firstly, you should compile the Specfem3D codes in ../SEMH directory
  Secondly, run the install.sh scripts in ../ directory to generate the DSM routinues.

######################################################################################

1.The basic parameter settings for the source and receiver are in file :parfile_for_benchmark

2.The computation parameter settings are in file : batch_run_benchmark_all_process.sh

3.The path settings for saving database and middle computation results by DSM/SEM3D hybrid method are in file:
- params.in
- parfile_for_benchmark
- batch_run_benchmark_all_process.sh

4.The DSM computation settings and input model are contained in:
./input_dsm/Double_para.txt
./input_dsm/FrqsMpi.txt
./input_dsm/iasp91
./input_dsm/iasp91_dsm
./input_dsm/st

5.The SEM3D computation parameters and path settings are in file:
./DATA/Par_file
./DATA/STATIONS
./DATA/CMTSOLUTION

6.The scripts control the Hybirid computaion is in ../shells/ directory.

Please do the modifications as the remarks state in the file/script above. 

################NEW CHANGE FOR DIFFERENT WAVEFIELD COMPUATION TYPE#####################
7.If you want to choose the computation include SH(only) / PSV(only) / FULL(SH+PSV) wavefields, please change the CHOICE variable to 1/2/3 separately in script: batch_run_benchmark_all_process.sh.
