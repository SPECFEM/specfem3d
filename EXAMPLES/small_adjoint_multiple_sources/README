Small adjoint simulation example (mostly meant for test purposes):
setup for a single station, used as adjoint source, and multiple CMTs given in CMTSOLUTION file

Idea:
We want to calculate the Green's functions from multiple source locations to a receiver.
Using reciprocity, we can input the impulsive source at the receiver and output the seismograms at the source positions.

To do so, we use a pure adjoint simulation (SIMULATION_TYPE == 2) with multiple CMTs defined in CMTSOLUTION,
and input as adjoint source signal in SEM/ an "impulsive" trace in one of the components.

To run the example simulation, use script:
> ./run_this_example.sh

Compare your seismograms in OUTPUT_FILES/ with the reference ones in directory REF_SEIS/
