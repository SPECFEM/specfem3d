 Parallel mesh decomposer

 Parallel heuristic mesh decomposer

 The decomposition is performed in the three Cartesian directions, given a
 desired number of partitions in each direction. The domain should be a box.

 Works for a topologically-rectangular domain in which the user has to
 specify the number of slices to decompose the mesh into in the X, Y and Z directions.
 Load imbalance is handled by taking into account the cost of the calculations inside each type
 of spectral elements: acoustic, elastic, viscoelastic, ...

 input_directory  = directory containing mesh files mesh_file,nodes_coords_file,.. = MESH
 output_directory = directory for output files proc***_Databases = defined in Par_file


 Par_file_faults not found: assuming that there are no faults
