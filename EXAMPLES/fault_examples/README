Examples contained in this folder help to familiarize yourself with simulations using
dynamic and kinematic sources defined along fault surfaces. We suggest to start with:

SCEC 3D benchmark examples (http://scecdata.usc.edu/cvws/):

- tpv5/: Nucleation followed by spontaneous rupture on a slightly stress-heterogeneous 
         vertical strike-slip fault in a homogeneous halfspace

- tpv15/: Nucleation followed by spontaneous rupture on a left-lateral, vertical, strike-slip fault 
          with a rightward branch forming a 30 degree angle.

- tpv16/: Nucleation followed by spontaneous rupture on a vertical strike-slip fault in a homogeneous halfspace. 
          There are randomly-generated heterogeneous initial stress conditions.

- tpv102/: Nucleation followed by spontaneous rupture on a vertical strike-slip fault in a homogeneous halfspace. 
           Rate-state friction, using an ageing law.

- tpv103/: Nucleation followed by spontaneous rupture on a vertical strike-slip fault in a homogeneous fullspace. 
           Rate-state friction, using a slip law with strong rate-weakening.
