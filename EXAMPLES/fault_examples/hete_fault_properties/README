###  The example is used to run a dynamic rupture model with prescribed heterogeneous friction parameters.

#  MESH
   The mesh file was created by the PYTHON scripts: 3D_CUBIT_mesh
   The 3D_CUBIT_mesh can also be downloaded on GitHub: 
       git clone git@github.com:Huihuiweng/3D_CUBIT_mesh.git

#  Initial shear stress
   The initial shear stres is provided in the file DATA/initial_stress.dat. Nearest interpolation is used.
   The format of this file is:
        Number_of_points
        X  Y  Z  value    
        ...
        X  Y  Z  value

#  Par_file_faults
   As an example here, the initial shear stress is read from file. You can extend it to any frictional parameters
   Such as: 
       &INIT_STRESS S1=0, S2=0, S3=-50.0e6, n2=1 /
       &DIST2D shapeval='read-from-file', filename='initial_stress.dat' /

#  Run the model
   First, install SPECFEM3D, then run this example:
       sh run_this_example.sh


#  Present the simulations results
   The output of simulations can be post-processed by the scripts Specfem3D_result_display
      git clone git@github.com:Huihuiweng/Specfem3D_result_display.git
