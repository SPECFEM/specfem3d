SCEC benchmark

This example is taken from the SCEC/USGS Spontaneous Rupture Code Verification Project:
- TPV102, a planar vertical strike-slip fault 
  w/ rate-and-State friction, ageing law, half-space


1. A default mesh is provided in MESH-default/ directory. 
  The script to generate this mesh using Cubit/Trelis can be run by:
  > ./TPV102.py

2. To run the simulation, type:
  > ./run_this_example.sh


Reference solutions are provided in REF_SEIS/ folder. 

Note that we use here as default setup a very coarse mesh resolution, with an element size of 4000m for testing purposes.
Additionally, to avoid comparing traces with almost zero amplitudes, only "significant" records are provided in REF_SEIS/.

For reproducing a SCEC benchmark, you would increase the mesh resolution in TPV102.jou accordingly.
