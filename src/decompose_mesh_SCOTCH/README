decompose mesh files:


****
you will need SCOTCH libraries to be installed on your system
(http://gforge.inria.fr/projects/scotch/) 

to compile this executable xdecompose_mesh_SCOTCH for partitioning your mesh files
****

  1. create mesh using CUBIT and scripts boundary_definition.py and
     cubit2specfem3D.py to generate all mesh files 

  2. compile executable "xdecompose_mesh_SCOTCH" in this directory decompose_mesh_SCOTCH/:
  
     make sure, you have the right location of your SCOTCH library defined
     in the Makefile (SCOTCH_LIBS), then type:
       
      > make
      
  3. create Database files for the number of partitions/processes you want SPECFEM
     to run on. These Database files will be needed later for the "xgenerate_databases" executable:     
       
      > ./xdecompose_mesh_SCOTCH n input_dir output_dir 
            
      where 
        - n is the number of partitions (i.e. parallel processes),
        - input_dir is the directory containing the mesh files (i.e. "nodes_coord_file","mesh_file",...)
        - output_dir is the directory to hold the new "proc****_Database" files
        
      for example, a call could look like:  
      
       > ./xdecompose_mesh_SCOTCH 4 ../EXAMPLES/homogeneous_halfspace/MESH/ ../DATABASES_MPI/
