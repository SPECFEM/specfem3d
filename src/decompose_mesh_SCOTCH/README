decompose mesh files:


****
you will need SCOTCH libraries to be installed on your system
(http://gforge.inria.fr/projects/scotch/)

to compile this executable xdecompose_mesh for partitioning your mesh files
****

  1. create mesh using CUBIT and scripts boundary_definition.py and
     cubit2specfem3D.py to generate all mesh files

  2. compile executable "xdecompose_mesh" in this directory decompose_mesh/:

     make sure, you have the right location of SCOTCH defined
     in the Makefile (SCOTCH_PATH), then type:

      > make

  3. create Database files for the number of partitions/processes you want SPECFEM3D
     to run on. These Database files will be needed later for the "xgenerate_databases" executable:

      > ./xdecompose_mesh n input_dir output_dir

      where
        - n is the number of partitions (i.e. parallel processes),
        - input_dir is the directory containing the mesh files (i.e. "nodes_coord_file","mesh_file",...)
        - output_dir is the directory to hold the new "proc****_Database" files

      for example, a call could look like:

       > ./xdecompose_mesh 4 ../examples/homogeneous_halfspace/MESH/ ../OUTPUT_FILES/DATABASES_MPI/
