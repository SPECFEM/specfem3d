.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBmcv\fP program converts Scotch mesh files from and to other
external file formats.
.PP
File \fIimfile\fP is converted into mesh file \fIomfile\fP, with optional
geometry data being put in geometry file \fIoxfile\fP, if it is
available.
.PP
When file names are not specified, data is read from standard input
and written to standard output. Standard streams can also be
explicitly represented by a dash '-'.
.PP
When the proper libraries have been included at compile time, \fBmcv\fP
can directly handle compressed meshes, both as input and output. A
stream is treated as compressed whenever its name is postfixed with
a compressed file extension, such as in 'brol.msh.bz2' or '-.gz'. The
compression formats which can be supported are the bzip2 format
('.bz2'), the gzip format ('.gz'), and the lzma format ('.lzma', on
input only).

Boeing-Harwell format. This is an elemental
matrix format. Only square matrices are supported. In
case the file contains several matrices, the \fInum\fP
parameter allow the user to provide the index of
the matrix to convert, starting from 0. When the \fInum\fP
parameter is not set, it is assumed to be 0.
