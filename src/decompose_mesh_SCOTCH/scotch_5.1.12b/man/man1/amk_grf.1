.SH NAME
\fBamk_grf \fP- create target architecture from source graph
\fB
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBamk_grf\fP [\fIoptions\fP] [\fIgfile\fP] [\fItfile\fP]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBamk_grf\fP program builds a decomposition-defined target
architecture \fItfile\fP from a source graph \fIgfile\fP.
.PP
Target architectures define the topology of the target graphs used
by static mapping programs \fBgmap\fP(1) and \fBdgmap\fP(1). Target
architectures can be either algorithmically-defined, for common,
regular topologies, or decomposition-defined, such as the ones
produced by \fBamk_grf\fP.
.PP
When the proper libraries have been included at compile time, \fBamk_grf\fP
can directly handle compressed files, both as input and output. A
stream is treated as compressed whenever its name is postfixed with
a compressed file extension, such as in 'brol.tgt.bz2' or '-.gz'. The
compression formats which can be supported are the bzip2 format
('.bz2'), the gzip format ('.gz'), and the lzma format ('.lzma', on
input only).
.PP
Since decomposition-defined target architecture files have a size
which is quadratic in the number of target vertices, because of the
presence of a distance matrix structure, using compressed files to
store them may save a lot of space.
.SH OPTIONS

.B
\fB-b\fP\fIstrat\fP
Apply bipartitioning strategy \fIstrat\fP to compute the
recursive bipartition of the whole source graph into
smaller target subdomains.

.B
\fB-l\fP\fIlfile\fP
Only keep vertices the indices of which belong to the
space-separated list stored in \fIlfile\fP. This allows one
to create target architectures which can even be
disjoint subsets of a larger target architecture,
modeled as a graph.

.SH EXAMPLE
Create a decomposition-defined target architecture from a 2D regular
grid source graph of dimension 3 times 5, and save it, as a compiled
target architecture, under the \fBgzip\fP(1) format, to file 'm3x5.tgt.gz'. 
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    $ gmk_m2 3 5 | amk_grf | acpl - m3x5.tgt.gz

.fam T
.fi
Note that, in this precise case, it would be much preferable to use
directly the 'mesh2D' algorithmically-defined target architecture.
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    $ echo "mesh2D 3 5" > m3x5.tgt
