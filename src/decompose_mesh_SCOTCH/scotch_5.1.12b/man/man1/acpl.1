\fBacpl \fP- compile a target architectures
\fB
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBacpl\fP [\fIoptions\fP] [\fIitfile\fP] [\fIotfile\fP]
.fam T

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBacpl\fP program compiles a decomposition-defined target
architecture file \fIitfile\fP of type '\fBdeco\fP 0' into a compiled
decomposition-defined target architecture of type '\fBdeco\fP 1', stored
in file \fIotfile\fP.
.PP
Compiling a decomposition-defined architecture amounts to computing
the distance matrix of all possible subdomains, from the distance
matrix of all terminal subdomains provided in the '\fBdeco\fP 0' format.
Since this computation is internally performed every time a '\fBdeco\fP 0'
format is read, and is quadratic in time, pre-compiling the target
architecture by means of \fBacpl\fP can save some time when repeatedly
computing mappings on a large decomposition-defined '\fBdeco\fP 0' target
architecture.
.PP
When the proper libraries have been included at compile time, \fBacpl\fP
can directly handle compressed files, both as input and output. A
stream is treated as compressed whenever its name is postfixed with
a compressed file extension, such as in 'brol.tgt.bz2' or '-.gz'. The
compression formats which can be supported are the bzip2 format
('.bz2'), the gzip format ('.gz'), and the lzma format ('.lzma', on
input only).
.PP
Since decomposition-defined target architecture files have a size
which is quadratic in the number of target vertices, because of the
distance matrix structures, using compressed files to store them may
save a lot of space, especially for compiled target architecture
files.

.SH EXAMPLE
Create a compiled cube-connected-cycle target architecture
of dimension 4, and save it under the \fBgzip\fP(1) format to
file 'ccc4c.tgt.gz'. The dash '-' standard file name is
used so that the '\fBdeco\fP 0' target architecture description
produced by \fBamk_ccc\fP(1) is read from the standard input,
through the pipe.
