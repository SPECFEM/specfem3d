.SH NAME
\fBgbase \fP- sets the base value of a source graph
\fB
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBgbase\fP [\fIoptions\fP] \fIbval\fP [\fIigfile\fP] [\fIogfile\fP]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBgbase\fP program allows one to set to \fIbval\fP the base value of a
source graph, that is, the starting index used to number its
vertices and edges. The base value can be set to 0 or 1, so that
graphs can be easily imported from and/or exported to tools written
in C or Fortran. Scotch can handle graphs irrespective of their base
value.
.PP
When the proper libraries have been included at compile time, \fBgbase\fP
can directly handle compressed graphs, both as input and output. A
stream is treated as compressed whenever its name is postfixed with
a compressed file extension, such as in 'brol.grf.bz2' or '-.gz'. The
compression formats which can be supported are the bzip2 format
('.bz2'), the gzip format ('.gz'), and the lzma format ('.lzma', on
input only).
