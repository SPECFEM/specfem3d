/* Dimitri Komatitsch, University of Toulouse, May 2011: */

/* added code to force Flush-To-Zero (FTZ) on Intel processors */
/* otherwise Gradual Underflow can be extremely slow. With Intel */
/* ifort one can use compiler option -ftz, but no such option exists */
/* in gcc and gfortran therefore we call an assembler routine directly here. */
/* Very precise description available at */
/* http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/x87-and-sse-floating-point-assists-in-ia-32-flush-to-zero-ftz-and-denormals-are-zero-daz/ */
/* and at http://www.rz.uni-karlsruhe.de/rz/docs/VTune/reference/vc148.htm */
/* from http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/x87-and-sse-floating-point-assists-in-ia-32-flush-to-zero-ftz-and-denormals-are-zero-daz : */

/* Flush-To-Zero (FTZ) mode */

/* FTZ is a method of bypassing IEEE 754 methods of dealing with */
/* invalid floating-point numbers due to underflows. This mode is much */
/* faster. Two conditions must be met for FTZ processing to occur: */

/*   * The FTZ bit (bit 15) in the MXCSR register must be masked (value = 1). */
/*   * The underflow exception (bit 11) needs to be masked (value = 1). */

#include "config.h"

#define FTZ_BIT 15
#define UNDERFLOW_EXCEPTION_MASK 11

#ifdef HAVE_XMMINTRIN
  #define FORCE_FTZ
  #include <xmmintrin.h>
#elif HAVE_EMMINTRIN
  #include <emmintrin.h>
  #define FORCE_FTZ
#endif

  /* force FTZ by setting bits 11 and 15 to one */
