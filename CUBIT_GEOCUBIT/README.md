Update by Emanuele Casarotti, INGV, Roma, Italy, January 2017:

I have finally concluded the review of geocubit for compatibility
issue with the last version of Trelis 16.
I have submitted to the repository the changes and I have tested the examples.
I'm waitinfg for travis.

As reported there some examples that fails: the CPML and the
tomography (we need to modify the starting toy model).

This is the list of updates made on Jan 5, 2017:

- compatibility with Coreform Cubit 15+ and 16+

- new merging chunk function (faster and more stable) for Coreform Cubit 15+ (before it was only for cubit 12.2)

- pep8 beautification

- bug fixes (including hex27 support in addition to hex8)

- alpha version of netcdf mesh for specfem3d

It aims at facilitating the meshing process in some common problems encountered in seismic or more generally acoustic wave propagation.
In particular, it is focused on the meshing requests of Specfem3D and it is helpful for such tedious tasks as:

• Creation of geophysical surfaces and volumes (ex. topography).

• Mesh of layered volumes with hexahedral.

• Creation of an anisotropic mesh suitable for cases where some alluvial basins (or slow velocity zones) are present.

• It can be used as a serial or parallel process. The parallel meshing capabilities are fun- damental for large geophysical problems (ex. mesh of Southern California using SRTM topography).

GeoCubit can be used inside the graphical interface of Trelis (i.e. as a Python object in the script tab) or as Unix command.

## Requirements:

- Coreform Cubit 15+ (https://coreform.com/products/coreform-cubit/, see also cubit.sandia.gov)
- python 2.7
- numpy 1.0+

It is possible that GEOCUBIT continues to work for CUBIT 15+ but it is not supported anymore.

## Configuration:

On Linux/Unix system: in order to have the possibility to import the cubit libray included in Cubit in a **python script** you should set up the path for Cubit

```
export CUBITDIR=$CUBITHOME
export CUBITLIB=$CUBITDIR/bin:$CUBITDIR/structure
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$CUBITDIR/bin:$CUBITDIR/structure
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$CUBITDIR/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$CUBITDIR/bin
```

You could install GEOCUBIT

`python setup.py install`

or

```
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:[YourGeocubitDir]
export PATH=$PATH:[YourGeocubitDir]
```



On MacOSX 10.10, Trelis points the system version of python2.7 (/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages)
so the version of python required is `/usr/bin/python2.7`

You could install GEOCUBIT with administrator privilege (for running script in the python tab of the Cubit GUI)

`/usr/bin/python2.7 setup.py install --install-lib=/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/`

and in addition if you want to run meshing scripts in python (outside of the GUI)   

```
export CUBITDIR=$CUBITHOME
export PYTHONPATH=$CUBITDIR/contents/MacOS:$PYTHONPATH
export CUBITLIB=$CUBITDIR/contents/MacOS
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CUBITDIR/contents/MacOS:${DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH}
export PATH=$PATH:$CUBITDIR:$CUBITDIR/Contents/MacOS
```

The meshing scripts works for `/usr/bin/python2.7`.

A simple "hello world" meshing script is:

```
import cubit
cubit.init([""])
cubit.cmd('brick x 10')
cubit.cmd('mesh vol all')
```

For defining the absorbing boundary surfaces in a 4 (near parallel) side meshed volume:

```
from geocubitlib import exportlib 
exportlib.collect(outdir='.',outfilename='mymesh')
```

The mesh will be exported in exodus format with name defined by the optional parameter `outfilename`:

For saving the mesh in Specfem3D format:

```
exportlib.e2SEM(outdir='.')
```
